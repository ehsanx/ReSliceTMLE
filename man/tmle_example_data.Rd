\title{Simulated Dataset for TMLE Examples}
\format{
A data frame with 5000 rows (1000 observations Ã— 5 simulations) and 8 variables:
\describe{
  \item{Y}{Binary outcome variable (0/1)}
  \item{A}{Binary treatment variable (0/1)}
  \item{X1}{Continuous covariate (standard normal distribution)}
  \item{X2}{Continuous covariate (standard normal distribution)}
  \item{X3}{Binary covariate (0/1 with 0.5 probability)}
  \item{X4}{Categorical covariate (factor with 3 levels)}
  \item{sim_id}{Simulation ID (1-5) for grouping observations}
  \item{true_effect}{True average treatment effect (0.25)}
}
}
\source{
Simulated data with data-generating process that ensures a true average 
  treatment effect of 0.25. The treatment assignment depends on covariates, 
  creating confounding that TMLE methods need to adjust for.
}
\usage{
tmle_example_data
}
\description{
A dataset containing simulated variables for demonstrating Targeted Maximum Likelihood
Estimation (TMLE) methods. The data includes a binary outcome, binary treatment,
various covariates, and a known true treatment effect (0.25) to evaluate
the performance of different TMLE methods.
