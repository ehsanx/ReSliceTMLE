\arguments{
\item{Y}{Outcome variable vector (binary 0/1)}

\item{A}{Treatment variable vector (binary 0/1)}

\item{W}{Covariate matrix or data frame}

\item{Q.SL.library}{SuperLearner library for outcome model}

\item{g.SL.library}{SuperLearner library for treatment model}

\item{V}{Number of CV folds}

\item{family}{Distribution family ("binomial" or "gaussian")}

\item{...}{Additional arguments}
}
\value{
A list containing full CV-TMLE results
}
\description{
Implements full cross-validated TMLE where initial Q and g are fitted on training
folds and then targeted on test folds. This avoids overfitting bias.
